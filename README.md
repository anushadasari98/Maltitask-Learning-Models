# Maltitask-Learning-Models
Implemented a Multi-Task deep neural network with Bi-directional LSTMs and Multi-armed bandits with Thompson Sampling to select the auxiliary tasks that improve the primary task from the GLUE benchmarks. Devised a weight learning method for mixing loss functions using Multi-armed bandits and Upper Confidence Bound.
